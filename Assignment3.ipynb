      "Everybody have cheated in the exams and even the teachers who say cheating is not true. I think cheating is a immoral behavior. Although I cheated in the exams I confess that it is not fair.\n",
      "Cheating in the exams sometimes is a simple desire for students and also is a way to prove yourself to your friends because you can show your friends how brave you are, most of the time it works because it needs an ability to do this and it is a sign of refusing the authority (teacher) in class. Everybody cannot achieve this (like me) Everybody tells about their cheating experiences as if they are proud of themselves. When the students cheat in the exam they have the feeling of winning the war against the teacher. It is not matter how they did. Now it is the turn for the students revenge. Student cheats and gets the revenge it is very simple. If we think about the colleges, teachers also support students to cheat in the exams. I do not know why but students prefer to find new strategies to cheat rather than studying. In fact it also needs intelligence; for example: girls write on their legs hands and on a paper which is inside their skirts, students write on desks wall, looking the paper of your friend next to you (most popular one). . . A lot of students prefer to write on small papers the night before the exam instead of studying.\n",
      "Students in colleges (like all students) have some reasons to cheat and they are right for these reasons; for instance the subjects are difficult and too much to study, teacher is not good etc. nobody says cheating is not true and they always try to prove their lessons considering of their behavior.\n",
      "Teachers attitudes towards cheating is not different from the students. Teachers do not allow cheating in the exam but during their lessons they talk about their experiences about cheating. Cheating is only disrespectful behavior towards teachers. Teachers do not think about other results of coping. Of course these things are not true for all teachers there are always some exceptions. Teachers only say cheating is bad but never explains why it is a bad behavior. Under these conditions students have a right to copy because they had never met something which shows the badness of cheating. Students do not think about other students in the exam, everyone tries to finish their papers. Among these students there are always some students who study for the exam, other students decide the clever boys seat and force him to show the answers. If the clever boy does not help others their relationship will get worse but if the clever boy helps he will betray his work, his sleepness nights. These contradictions are true for every step of our life, you work so hard and the others exploit work, it is the same for cheating. Cheating is an insult to take one who works and to the one who want to see his/her results.\n",
